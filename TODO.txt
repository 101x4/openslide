Error handling

Bacus
 - Store filenames and use open/close instead of fopen/fclose. It is necessary
   for handling so many files.

Zeiss/MIRAX
 - Change _openslide_jpeg_fragment thing into layers of fragments, this
   will allow specifing the w/h and overlaps for a layer, as well as
   avoiding generating many blank images temporarily. This is necessary
   for the MIRAX format.
 - Make sure downsamples are correctly computed. This should follow from
   explicitly specifying the w/h per layer.
 - Properties/associated images/comment.
